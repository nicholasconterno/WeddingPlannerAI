## Project Purpose

My sister is getting married in the next summer, and has been having to be put through all of the stresses of planning her wedding. A lot of what a wedding planner does is deal with the brides requests, deal with vendors, and have information from the past from her other planned events. 

I thought this might be able to be achieved with an AI agent. 

In theory, an AI agent could deal with a lot of these tasks, but for this project I am attempting just a small part as a sort of proof of concept for the idea as a whole. In a sense it as an excuse to use SLMs as well, but the project as a business, would likely use something more SOTA. 

In this project, we simply have an AI agent which is attempting to acquire information from a vendor through constant communication. Then relaying that information back to the user, who also privded the initial prompt. 

Then the AI agent can also provide possible next steps or a summary of the quotes found to a certain stage.
